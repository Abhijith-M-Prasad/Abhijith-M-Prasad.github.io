            <h4>Fuel Cover state and contact point Detection in cars for automated fuel filling using Computer Vision and Deep Learning:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>objective:</b> from the camera frames predict, bounding box for localizing fuel cover, classify weather it is fully open , closed or in between and key-points for robotic arm to latch on and operate on the fuel cover</li>
              <li><b>Data:</b> this was the most  challenging part we used smartphone to collect images and labelled it using opensource tool labelme. Then converted labels it to fit the custom detection head. The dataset was very limited hence we have to use pretrained networks and extensive data augmentations.</li>
              <li><b>Model:</b> A single stage Yolo like model was implemented, it uses pretrained ResNet50 as backbone and a custom CNN head which initializes a raster for detection of fuel cover and contact point.</li>
              <li><b>Loss Function:</b>it uses a custom implemented Yolo like loss function cross entropy for classification, binary cross entropy for detection and MSE loss for bounding box and contact point, with weighting hyperparameters for different loss components.</li>
              <li><b>Training:</b> cached the backbone features and trained CNN head till convergence and then unfreezed the top layers of backbone and trained full model till convergence.</li>
              <li><b>Data Augmentations:</b>Used Albumentations library, written custom data augmentations e.g. the fuel covers have stickers on them so we can use that as a mode of data augmentation.</li>
              <li><b>Inference:</b> run the model in evaluation mode and also implemented a post processing that overlays the bounding box and contact point to the video frame.</li>
              <li><b>Future Work:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>implement a data engine (similar to tesla)</li> 
                  <li>implement LoRa, since we have 2 task fuel cap and filler cap detection we do not want to use 2 separate backbone rather use 2 switchable LoRa model for single backbone for 2 tasks.</li>
                  <li>stereoscopic depth (occupancy tracking like functionality)</li>
                  <li>Robotic arm integration</li>

          <h4>Prediction of optimum PV Array configuration for a small scale solar plant with an unavoidable fixed object shading the plant using MATLAB.</h4>          
          <ul>
            <li>Utilized MATLAB for predicting the optimum configuration of a PV Array for a small-scale solar plant affected by unavoidable fixed object shading. </li>
            <li>Conceptualized an idea leveraging the periodic motion of the sun relative to the earth, translating shade patterns into periodic simulations across different configurations.</li>
            <li>Led a team in the Research Project to program MATLAB and Simulink, enabling simulations for determining the optimal configuration despite the fixed object shading.</li>    
            <li>Identified that selecting the optimal configuration significantly improves efficiency, thereby enhancing power generation over the plant's lifespan.</li>             
            <li>Conducted seasonal analysis using MATLAB programs, indicating time-averaged efficiency for various configurations: SP-10.24%, TCT-10.56%, Sudoku-10.46%. The analysis recommended the TCT configuration as the optimum choice at 10.56% efficiency.</li>
            <li>Emphasized the significance of a 0.1% efficiency increase, accumulating over the solar plant's lifespan (25-40 years), resulting in substantial energy savings. </li>
            <li>Summary: Achieved the determination of the optimal configuration by measuring time-averaged efficiency through comprehensive simulations.</li>
